I am starting this small project because we had to delete some users from our Flarum forum.
Looking for support I find this https://discuss.flarum.org/d/6680-remove-delete-user so here is my solution.

Without access via phpMyAdmin you can easily delete users. No need to install any extension.

## Installation

Download this file php and fill the basic configuration: _connection to your MySQL db_, _admin access password_, _customization_.
Than upload it in root folder of your Flarum forum with FTP.
